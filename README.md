# Overview
This is a demo CRUD service by using NodeJS and Neo4j (Please check this article https://www.ru-rocker.com/2018/08/28/how-to-make-a-simple-crud-example-using-expressjs-and-neo4j/).

# REST
This demo is about creating, updating, retrieveng and deleting companies object via web service.
The web service itself will be exposed as a REST service, following its standard:
* POST: to create a company
* PUT: to update a company
* GET: to retrieve comapanies
* DELETE: to remove companies
Default path is `http://localhost:3000`.

# NodeJS
For this purpose, I will use `ExpressJS` as a web application framework. 
As a basic setup, I use express generator.
For authentication I use JWT mechanism, by using `PassportJS`
And several supporting libraries such as `swagger`, `morgan`, `lodash`.
Least, for connecting to Neo4j, I use official neo4j javascript driver `neo4j-driver`.
